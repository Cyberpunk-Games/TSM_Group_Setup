# World of Warcraft - Shadowlands TSM4 Groups

TSM4 Group Setup made by MonChiSub#0001
Setup is used by streamer [StudenAlbatroz](https://www.twitch.tv/studenalbatroz), due to popular request, I have published my setup for the whole community to use for free. 

> 01/02/2022 Changes
> - Removed single export file due to the export being too big and causing errors.
> - Added individual group exports, due to TSM4 Errors

> 24/01/2022 Changes
> - Added a load of missing level 1 & 25 pets to the groups
> - Added a couple of Vanilla - BfA transmog items
> - Increased normal operation price for transmog (Was posting below region market avg, should now post at or just above (based on region sale avg and historical too)).
> - Probably added other things, I forgot about, who knows?

> 04/01/2022 Changes
